### AliasSubStruct

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

AliasSubStruct is an aliased struct, it will be added to the documentation with an identical
members table as the origin struct.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `NonTaggedField` | _bool_ | NonTaggedField doesn't have a tag, so the name will be capitalised. |

### AliasedExternalMap
#### (`map[string]any` alias)

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

AliasedExternalMap is an alias type for a map type outside of the package.

### AnEmbeddedStruct

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

AnEmbeddedStruct gets embedded within other structures.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `embeddedDuration` | _duration_ | EmbeddedDuration is a duration within an embedded struct. |

### MyDuration
#### (`int64` alias)

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

MyDuration is an alias to a duration.

### MyDurationString
#### (`string` alias)

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

MyDuration is an alias to a duration with the type overridden as a string

### MyTestStruct

MyTestStruct contains a collection of fields all attempting to test various
aspects of the code generation.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `name` | _string_ | Name is the name of the MyTestStruct. |
| `longMessageInt` | _int_ | LongMessageInt has a very long message, very very very very very very<br/>very very very very very very very very very very very very very very<br/>very very very very very very very very very very very very very very<br/>very very very very very very very very very very very very very very<br/>very very very very very very very very very very very very very very<br/>long message attached to the top of it.<br/>This should prove how the generator handles long doc strings. |
| `subStruct` | _[SomeSubStruct](#somesubstruct)_ | SubStruct is a struct referenced from within the parent struct.<br/>This should get its own section in the referenced docs. |
| `subStructMap` | _[map[string]SomeSubStruct](#somesubstruct)_ | SubStructMap is a map of a known struct type. |
| `embeddedDuration` | _duration_ | EmbeddedDuration is a duration within an embedded struct. |
| `aliasedDuration` | _[MyDuration](#myduration)_ | AliasedDuration is a type alias to a duration. |
| `aliasedDurationString` | _[MyDurationString](#mydurationstring)_ | AliasDurationString is a type alias to a duration that should be documented<br/>as a string type. |
| `pointerString` | _string_ | PointerString shows that the docs gen strips the pointer (*) from the beginning<br/>of the type when documented. |
| `private` | _[PrivateMembers](#privatemembers)_ | Private should be included as a new struct, but without any documented members. |
| `aliasedStruct` | _[AliasSubStruct](#aliassubstruct)_ | AliasedStruct is a type aliased struct |
| `externalMap` | _text/template.FuncMap_ | ExternalMap references and external map type outisde of the package. |
| `aliasExternalMap` | _[AliasedExternalMap](#aliasedexternalmap)_ | AliasExternalMap references an external map type outside of the package via an alias. |
| `bytes` | _[]byte_ | Bytes is a slice of raw byte data. |

### PrivateMembers

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

PrivateMembers only has private members so when documented, should not have a members table printed.

### SomeSubStruct

(**Appears on:** [MyTestStruct](#myteststruct))

SomeSubStruct is a struct to go within another struct.

| Field | Type | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----------- |
| `NonTaggedField` | _bool_ | NonTaggedField doesn't have a tag, so the name will be capitalised. |
